Revision history for Perl extension Cikl

0.5.0 2014-03-25T16:00:04Z
    - Stripped out all the server-side code, given that we are shifting focus
    to using Logstash as the 'backend'. 

    - Spint RabbitMQ out to its own perl module to reduce dependencies of the
    core library.

0.4.1 2014-03-05T17:47:15Z

    - Ugh, use better versioning. 

0.04 2014-03-03T20:02:05Z

    - Remove test-rules to reduce dist size.    

0.03 2014-03-03T19:16:36Z

    - Try pushing our stuff up to CPAN

0.02 2014-03-03T17:28:32Z

    - Clean up dependencies
      - Set minimum version of perl to 5.014
      - Stop using MouseX::NativeTraits - we really don't benefit.
      - Remove lots of unused stuff.

    - Require Cikl::DataTypes::* explicitly (was seeing dependency issues on 
      travis)
